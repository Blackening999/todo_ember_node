todo_node_ember
===========

TodoMVC using Ember, Node, Gulp, Mongo.

This is a Todo MVC app, using recent technologies: Ember.js + Ember Data on client-side and 
Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Mongoose on server-side.

App has a REST architecture and just a good example of interaction using Node and Ember. 
Also - this application uses Gulp - the perfect alternation to Grunt.

The idea to create this application is to fill the white spots in the area of how to link these technologies together
and have a good application structure at the same time!

Enjoy!
